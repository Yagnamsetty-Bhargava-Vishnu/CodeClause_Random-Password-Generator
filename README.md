# CodeClause_Random-Password-Generator-in-Python

A random password generator is a useful tool in Python that generates secure and unpredictable passwords. It is commonly used to enhance the security of user accounts by generating strong passwords that are resistant to brute-force attacks.

In this code, the generate_password function takes an optional parameter length that specifies the desired length of the password. It uses the random.choice function to randomly select characters from a combination of ASCII letters, digits, 
and punctuation symbols. The string module provides constants like ascii_letters, digits, and punctuation which contain the respective characters. The join method is used to concatenate the randomly selected characters into a string.

By default, the password generator generates an 8-character password. However, you can pass a different length as an argument to the generate_password function to generate passwords of varying lengths.
